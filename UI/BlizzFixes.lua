-- Normally the rider flies from over the saddle into it every time you switch to another mount.
-- It seems that the playerActor starts with some animation, which has that as first position.
-- With the AnimationBlendOperation=ANIM and some other SetAnimation() call during mountActor:AttachToMount()
-- the rider basically blends back into the saddle.
-- Therefore setting the AnimationBlendOperation=NONE beforehand avoids that issue.

-- Rotating the display camera wildly extends the internal vector further and further.
-- At some point on very high/low values the UI bugs with an error. (https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mount-journal-enhanced/issues/97)
-- Although that might only happen with an unlocked Y-rotation/pitch.
-- Also, when resetting the camera the whole rotation gets reverted. That looks a bit funny.
--
-- To fix both we keep the rotation values within a fixed boundary of -2*PI and 2*PI. That prevents the LUA error and
-- keeps the reset rotation short.
