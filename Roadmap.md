### Next
- special summon animation
- switch through mount variation (eg. High Priest's Lightsworn Seeker: C_MountJournal.GetMountAllCreatureDisplayInfoByID(861))

### More Ideas:
- more animation control in display (start/pause, movements, with sound effects)
- color filter
- variation filter (undead, mech, elemental, magic...)
- option: auto favorite new mounts; even those learned during offline time/on alts
- favorite groups / custom filter groups
- favorite menu at SummonRandomFavoriteButton?
- link to wowhead (?)
- display Rarity / x Percentage of all worldwide players have that (Retail) - if I can find a nice source for that
- Mount Score Rating (based on rarity?)
