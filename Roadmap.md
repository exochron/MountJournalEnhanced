### Next
- personal favorites rework
- special summon animation

### More Ideas:
- activate sound effects in display (with global setting)
- more animation control in display (start/pause, movements)
- gallery mode (like wardrobe)
- gamepad support (?)
- variation filter (undead, mech, elemental, magic...)
- proper favorite profiles with one global profile
- favorite groups / custom filter groups
- favorite menu at SummonRandomFavoriteButton?
- link to wowhead (?)
- Mount Score Rating (based on rarity?)
- disable ingame sound effects of mounts (currently no api for that)

### Stupid Ideas :D
(maybe for april fool's)
- googly eyes (like in overwatch)
- who's that mount:
  - Only Display, but the mount is completely black
  - multiple choice (4?); never use an alternative option of the same family
  - 10? rounds
- Pimp my Mount: more effects in display, like:
    - underbody lightning
    - sunglasses for mount
- retro UI: like in WotLK
