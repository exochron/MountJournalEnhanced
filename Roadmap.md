### 2.8
- sort options (=> https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mount-journal-enhanced/issues/43)
    - list favorites between everything else (beware auto favorite logic)
    - mix unowned & owned depending by sort order
    - sort by name asc/desc
    - sort by expansion asc/desc (actually just by mountid)
    - sort by type/family
    - sort by usage
- switch through mount variation (eg. High Priest's Lightsworn Seeker: C_MountJournal.GetMountAllCreatureDisplayInfoByID(861))

### More Ideas:
- more animation control in display (start/pause, movements, with sound effects)
- color filter
- variation filter (undead, mech, elemental, magic...)
- option: auto favorite new mounts; even those learned during offline time/on alts
- favorite groups / custom filter groups
- favorite menu at SummonRandomFavoriteButton?
