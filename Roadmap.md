### Todos:
still tainting:
  - with unloaded collections: learn a mount and click the alert: MountJournal.ListScrollFrame.offset is tainted


### Next
- automatic favor new mounts
- special summon animation
- switch through mount variation (eg. High Priest's Lightsworn Seeker: C_MountJournal.GetMountAllCreatureDisplayInfoByID(861))

### More Ideas:
- more animation control in display (start/pause, movements, with sound effects)
- color filter
- variation filter (undead, mech, elemental, magic...)
- option: auto favorite new mounts; even those learned during offline time/on alts
- favorite groups / custom filter groups
- favorite menu at SummonRandomFavoriteButton?
