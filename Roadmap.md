### 2.6 (Next - ptr-8.2.5)
- toggle rider in display

### More Ideas:
- more animation control in display (start/pause, movements, with sound effects)
- color filter
- variation filter (undead, mech, elemental, magic...)
- option: auto favorite new mounts; even those learned during offline time/on alts
- favorite groups / custom filter groups
- favorite menu at SummonRandomFavoriteButton?
